# ProofChain - Digital Receipts + Warranty System

A blockchain-based digital receipt and warranty management system built on Stacks using Clarinet 2.0+. ProofChain creates immutable, NFT-based receipts with embedded warranty information and automated claim processing.

## üåü Features

  "Gaming Laptop X1"        ;; Product name
  u150000                   ;; Price in microSTX (1500 STX)
  u365                      ;; Warranty period (1 year)
  "manufacturer"            ;; Warranty type
  (some "ipfs://metadata")) ;; Optional metadata URI
```

### For Customers

#### 1. Check Warranty Status
```clarity
;; Check if warranty is still valid
(contract-call? .proofchain check-warranty-status u1)
```

#### 2. Submit Warranty Claim
```clarity

(contract-call? .proofchain submit-warranty-claim 
  u1              ;; Receipt ID
  "repair"        ;; Claim type: "repair", "refund", "replacement"
  u50000)         ;; Claim amount in microSTX
```

#### 3. Transfer Receipt
```clarity
;; Transfer receipt to new owner (for resale/gift)
(contract-call? .proofchain transfer-receipt u1 'SP2NEWOWNER...)
```

### For Admins

#### Process Warranty Claims
```clarity
;; Approve or reject warranty claim
(contract-call? .proofchain process-warranty-claim 
  u1           ;; Receipt ID
